Hydra, a non-malicious self-replicating program üêç
--------------------------------------------------
This program was developed as a personal challenge
to replicate the functionality of the hydra program
available at https://www.windows93.net/. It is labeled as
non-malicious, as it does not harbor any harmful intent
towards the user's system. The program does not possess
any capability to infect or compromise the victim's system.
The only potential negative impact (other than being a nuisance)
could arise from the creation of a significant number of
program instances, potentially leading to the exhaustion of
system resources and subsequent performance degradation.
It is worth noting that once initiated, terminating the
program will necessitate restarting the affected machine.
